# Concept to Cash
Presented at [DDD Brisbane 2015](http://dddbrisbane.com) with [Deckset](http://decksetapp.com) "Ostrich" theme in the pink/orange-on-blue color scheme.

Side projects are common for a lot of programmers. Programmers love building things. What if you could sell it? Modern app stores make it easy to publish apps but how do you build something that normal people would actually buy? There's a big gap between a talking about an app idea and actually shipping and earning money from it. 

This session will cover everything it takes to go from a 'great idea' to actually shipping a product and selling it on an app store! Things like platform and technology choice, product design and user experience, finding a designer and working with them, finding people to test it, publishing it to an app store, how to market it so people can actually find it and buy it, how to handle support if things break, staying motivated to finish the project and making trade-offs necessary to actually ship.
